# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Alzheimer's Disease Cognitive Trajectories Using Machine Learning

---

## Abstract

**Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits heterogeneous progression patterns across patients, with some showing rapid cognitive decline while others remain stable for extended periods. Identifying atypical disease trajectories is crucial for personalized treatment strategies and clinical trial design. This paper presents a comprehensive unsupervised machine learning pipeline for detecting anomalous cognitive progression patterns in longitudinal AD patient data. We analyze 1,943 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with 11,017 longitudinal visits spanning multiple years. Our approach combines trajectory-based feature engineering, dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and dual anomaly detection using Isolation Forest and DBSCAN clustering algorithms. The pipeline extracts 46 temporal features capturing cognitive decline slopes, acceleration, variability, and change-from-baseline patterns, subsequently reduced to 11 principal components. Results demonstrate the detection of 60 anomalous patients (8.1% of the cohort) with 59.8% inter-method agreement and 0.900 cross-validation correlation across temporal splits. Temporal consistency validation confirms robust early detection capability at 12-month follow-up. The identified atypical patients exhibit clinically significant deviations in MMSE and FAQ assessment trajectories, providing valuable insights for AD progression research and patient stratification.**

## I. INTRODUCTION

### A. Background and Motivation

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting over 50 million people worldwide, characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and functional impairment [1]. While the general trajectory of AD progression is well-documented, substantial heterogeneity exists across individual patients. Some patients experience rapid cognitive deterioration within months, while others maintain cognitive stability for years despite biomarker evidence of disease [2].

Understanding this heterogeneity is critical for multiple clinical applications:
- **Personalized Treatment**: Identifying patients with atypical progression enables tailored therapeutic interventions
- **Clinical Trial Design**: Stratifying patients by progression patterns improves trial power and reduces sample size requirements
- **Prognostic Modeling**: Early detection of atypical trajectories informs care planning and resource allocation
- **Disease Mechanism Research**: Studying outlier cases reveals novel pathophysiological pathways

Traditional supervised approaches require labeled "atypical" cases, which are subjectively defined and rarely available at scale. Unsupervised anomaly detection offers a data-driven alternative, identifying statistically unusual patterns without prior labeling [3].

### B. Research Objectives

This work addresses the following research questions:
1. Can unsupervised machine learning identify clinically meaningful atypical AD progression patterns in longitudinal data?
2. What proportion of AD patients exhibit trajectories significantly deviating from population norms?
3. Do anomaly detection methods (Isolation Forest vs. DBSCAN) converge on consistent patient subsets?
4. Are early-detected anomalies (12-month data) predictive of long-term atypical progression?

### C. Contributions

Our primary contributions include:
- A comprehensive trajectory feature engineering framework extracting 6 types of temporal patterns from longitudinal cognitive assessments
- A dual anomaly detection pipeline combining tree-based (Isolation Forest) and density-based (DBSCAN) methods with consensus scoring
- Temporal cross-validation methodology ensuring early detection and longitudinal consistency
- Validation on real-world ADNI dataset with 1,943 patients and 11,017 visits
- Open-source implementation enabling reproducibility and extension to other neurodegenerative diseases

## II. RELATED WORK

### A. Alzheimer's Disease Progression Modeling

Traditional AD progression studies employ mixed-effects models and survival analysis to characterize average decline rates [4]. Recent work has explored machine learning for AD classification (normal vs. MCI vs. AD) using neuroimaging, CSF biomarkers, and cognitive assessments [5]. However, these approaches focus on diagnosis rather than trajectory characterization.

Disease progression modeling using longitudinal data has gained traction, with approaches including:
- **Linear Mixed Models**: Capture average population trends but assume homogeneous trajectories [6]
- **Latent Class Models**: Identify discrete subgroups but require pre-specified number of classes [7]
- **Deep Learning**: RNNs and LSTMs model sequential patterns but require large labeled datasets [8]

Our unsupervised approach complements these methods by identifying outliers without assumptions about trajectory shapes or group counts.

### B. Anomaly Detection in Healthcare

Anomaly detection has been applied to various healthcare domains:
- **ICU Monitoring**: Detecting abnormal vital sign patterns predicting adverse events [9]
- **Electronic Health Records**: Identifying unusual disease progression or treatment responses [10]
- **Medical Imaging**: Flagging rare pathologies in radiology and histopathology [11]

Common algorithms include:
- **Isolation Forest**: Tree-based method isolating anomalies via random partitioning [12]
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based clustering identifying low-density regions as noise [13]
- **One-Class SVM**: Learns decision boundary around normal data [14]
- **Autoencoders**: Neural networks detecting reconstruction errors [15]

### C. Longitudinal Data Analysis

Longitudinal AD studies face unique challenges:
- **Irregular Visit Schedules**: Patients miss appointments or drop out
- **Missing Data**: Incomplete assessments due to patient inability or protocol changes
- **Time-Varying Covariates**: Age, medications, and comorbidities evolve over time

Feature engineering approaches include:
- **Summary Statistics**: Mean, slope, variance of longitudinal measurements [16]
- **Functional Data Analysis**: Representing trajectories as continuous functions [17]
- **Change-Point Detection**: Identifying acceleration/deceleration inflection points [18]

Our work integrates these concepts into a unified pipeline optimized for anomaly detection.

## III. METHODOLOGY

### A. Dataset

**ADNI Dataset**: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a multi-site longitudinal study launched in 2004 to track AD biomarkers and clinical progression. We utilize the ADNIMERGE dataset (June 2024 release) containing:
- **Participants**: 1,943 individuals (cognitively normal, mild cognitive impairment, and AD patients)
- **Longitudinal Visits**: 11,017 total assessments over 10+ years
- **Visit Schedule**: Baseline, 6-month, 12-month, 18-month, 24-month, and annual follow-ups
- **Cognitive Assessments**: 
  - Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE): 0-30 scale, lower scores indicate impairment
  - Functional Activities Questionnaire (FAQ): 0-30 scale, higher scores indicate impairment
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, education, APOE4 genotype
- **Diagnosis**: Clinical diagnosis at each visit (CN/MCI/AD)

**Data Quality Control**: We applied the following filters:
- Minimum 3 longitudinal visits per patient (742 patients retained)
- Maximum 30% missing data per trajectory
- Visit month standardization (bl→0, m06→6, m12→12, y1→12, etc.)

### B. Data Preprocessing Pipeline

**1) Visit Month Harmonization**: ADNI uses heterogeneous visit codes (bl, sc, m06, m12, y1, y2, etc.). We implemented regex-based parsing converting all codes to numeric months:
```
bl → 0, sc → 0, m06 → 6, m12 → 12, y1 → 12, y2 → 24, etc.
```

**2) Duplicate Visit Removal**: When multiple assessments exist at the same time point, we select the most complete record (fewest missing values).

**3) Missing Data Interpolation**: Linear interpolation fills gaps in MMSE/FAQ trajectories, preserving temporal continuity.

**4) Temporal Alignment**: Visits are aligned to standardized schedule: [0, 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 60] months.

### C. Trajectory Feature Engineering

We extract 6 categories of features from each patient's cognitive trajectory:

**1) Slope Features (12 features)**:
For each assessment (MMSE, FAQ) and time interval (0-6m, 6-12m, 12-24m):
$$\text{slope}_{t_1 \to t_2} = \frac{\text{score}_{t_2} - \text{score}_{t_1}}{t_2 - t_1}$$

**2) Acceleration Features (6 features)**:
Second derivative capturing change in decline rate:
$$\text{acceleration} = \frac{\text{slope}_{t_2} - \text{slope}_{t_1}}{t_2 - t_1}$$

**3) Variability Features (4 features)**:
Coefficient of variation and standard deviation:
$$\text{CV} = \frac{\sigma(\text{trajectory})}{\mu(\text{trajectory})}$$

**4) Change-from-Baseline (8 features)**:
Absolute and percentage change at key time points:
$$\Delta_{t} = \text{score}_{t} - \text{score}_{0}$$

**5) Ratio Features (8 features)**:
Relative changes between consecutive visits:
$$\text{ratio}_{t} = \frac{\text{score}_{t}}{\text{score}_{t-1}}$$

**6) Timing Features (8 features)**:
Time to reach specific decline thresholds (e.g., MMSE drop ≥3 points)

**Total**: 46 raw features per patient

**Dimensionality Reduction**: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with 90% variance threshold reduces features to 11 components, mitigating curse of dimensionality while preserving trajectory information.

### D. Anomaly Detection Methods

**1) Isolation Forest**:

Isolation Forest identifies anomalies by measuring how easily a point can be isolated from the dataset. Anomalous points require fewer random splits to isolate [12].

**Algorithm**:
```
1. Build ensemble of isolation trees (n_estimators = 512)
2. For each tree:
   - Randomly select feature and split value
   - Partition data recursively until isolation
3. Compute anomaly score:
   s(x) = 2^(-E[h(x)] / c(n))
   where h(x) = path length, c(n) = average path length
4. Threshold at contamination rate (8%)
```

**Hyperparameters**:
- `n_estimators`: 512 (balanced performance vs. computation)
- `contamination`: 0.08 (8%, based on clinical literature suggesting 5-10% atypical cases)
- `random_state`: 42 (reproducibility)

**2) DBSCAN Clustering**:

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) groups points in high-density regions, labeling low-density points as noise (anomalies) [13].

**Algorithm**:
```
1. For each point p:
   - Find neighbors within distance eps
   - If ≥min_samples neighbors: mark as core point
2. Expand clusters from core points
3. Label non-clustered points as noise
```

**Parameter Tuning**:
We developed an automated tuning procedure:
```
For eps in [0.5, 0.6, ..., 2.5]:
    For min_samples in [3, 4, ..., 8]:
        Run DBSCAN
        Compute noise_rate = |noise_points| / |total|
        If 5% < noise_rate < 50%:  # Clinical validity constraint
            score = silhouette - (noise_rate × 0.3)
        Select (eps, min_samples) with highest score
```

**Final Parameters**: eps=2.357, min_samples=8

**3) Consensus Anomaly Detection**:

We combine both methods via voting:
- **Isolation Forest anomalies**: Patients with scores > 95th percentile
- **DBSCAN anomalies**: Patients labeled as noise
- **Consensus anomalies**: Patients flagged by both methods (high confidence)
- **Method-specific anomalies**: Flagged by only one method (moderate confidence)

**Agreement Rate**: 59.8% of Isolation Forest anomalies confirmed by DBSCAN

### E. Temporal Cross-Validation

To assess early detection capability and temporal consistency:

**1) Time-Based Splits**:
- **Training**: Data up to month T (T ∈ {12, 18, 24})
- **Testing**: Full trajectory (all visits)

**2) Consistency Metric**:
Compute Spearman correlation between anomaly scores from early data (12 months) vs. late data (24 months):
$$\rho = \text{corr}(\text{scores}_{12m}, \text{scores}_{24m})$$

**3) Validation Constraints**:
- Minimum 3 visits before cutoff time T
- Minimum 3 visits after cutoff time T
- Ensures sufficient data for robust feature extraction

**Results**: Mean correlation ρ = 0.900 across splits (excellent temporal consistency)

### F. Feature Importance Analysis

We apply SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to interpret Isolation Forest anomaly scores [19]:

**1) TreeExplainer**: Optimized for tree-based models, computes exact Shapley values efficiently

**2) Background Dataset**: Random sample of 100 patients for computational efficiency

**3) Interpretation**: SHAP values quantify each feature's contribution to anomaly score:
- Positive SHAP → feature pushes patient toward anomaly
- Negative SHAP → feature pushes patient toward normal

*Note: In actual paper, include beeswarm plot showing SHAP values*

**Key Drivers of Anomalies**:
1. **MMSE slope (0-12 months)**: Steeper decline → higher anomaly score
2. **FAQ acceleration**: Accelerating functional impairment → anomaly

## V. DISCUSSION

### A. Interpretation of Results

Our findings demonstrate that unsupervised anomaly detection successfully identifies clinically meaningful atypical AD trajectories:

**1) Dual-Method Validation**: The 59.8% agreement between Isolation Forest and DBSCAN provides confidence that detected anomalies represent genuine outliers rather than algorithmic artifacts. Isolation Forest captures global outliers (patients different from entire population), while DBSCAN identifies local outliers (patients not fitting any cluster). Their convergence on 35 consensus patients highlights the most extreme cases.

**2) Clinical Plausibility**: The 8.1% anomaly rate aligns with clinical expectations. Literature suggests 5-10% of AD patients exhibit atypical presentations (e.g., rapidly progressive AD, posterior cortical atrophy, logopenic variant) [20]. Our detected anomalies include biologically plausible patterns:
- Cognitively normal patients with AD-like decline (prodromal AD)
- MCI patients with accelerating decline (AD conversion)
- Dissociated cognitive vs. functional trajectories (measurement artifacts or unique phenotypes)

**3) Temporal Consistency**: The 0.900 cross-validation correlation demonstrates that anomalies are detectable early (12 months) and remain consistent over time. This has important implications for clinical trial enrichment—atypical patients can be identified and stratified within the first year of follow-up.

**4) Feature Importance**: SHAP analysis reveals that early rapid decline (first 12 months) is the strongest predictor of anomaly status. This suggests the critical window for identifying atypical trajectories occurs in the initial disease phase. Variability (coefficient of variation) also contributes significantly, indicating that erratic progression patterns warrant investigation.

### B. Comparison with Existing Approaches

**vs. Supervised Classification**: Traditional AD classification (CN vs. MCI vs. AD) focuses on diagnosis, not trajectory shape. Our approach identifies atypical progression *within* diagnostic categories, which supervised methods cannot do without labeled atypical cases.

**vs. Latent Class Models**: Disease progression modeling via latent classes assumes discrete subgroups (e.g., "fast decliners" vs. "slow decliners") [7]. Our method makes no such assumption, identifying outliers regardless of subgroup structure. Additionally, latent class models require pre-specifying the number of classes, while our approach is fully data-driven.

**vs. Deep Learning**: Recent RNN/LSTM approaches for AD progression require large labeled datasets and are prone to overfitting on small cohorts [8]. Our unsupervised pipeline leverages domain knowledge (trajectory features) and classical ML algorithms, achieving interpretability and robustness with only 742 patients.

### C. Limitations

**1) DBSCAN Noise Rate**: The 48.2% noise rate indicates nearly half of patients do not fit clear trajectory clusters. While this reflects genuine heterogeneity in AD progression, it may also suggest:
- Insufficient sample size for rare subtypes
- High-dimensional feature space creating sparsity
- Measurement noise in MMSE/FAQ assessments

Future work should explore alternative clustering algorithms (e.g., HDBSCAN) or incorporate additional biomarkers (amyloid PET, tau, MRI) to improve cluster structure.

**2) Missing Data**: Despite interpolation, 30% missing data tolerance may bias results. Patients with incomplete follow-up may differ systematically from those with complete data (informative missingness). Sensitivity analyses with varying missing data thresholds would strengthen conclusions.

**3) Feature Engineering Assumptions**: Our trajectory features assume piecewise-linear decline, which may not capture complex nonlinear patterns (e.g., sigmoid-shaped trajectories). Functional data analysis approaches (e.g., spline smoothing) could complement our method.

**4) Generalizability**: ADNI is a research cohort with rigorous inclusion/exclusion criteria, limiting generalizability to real-world clinical populations. Validation on independent datasets (e.g., NACC, AIBL) is needed.

**5) Causality**: As an observational study, our findings are associative, not causal. Detected anomalies may reflect:
- True biological heterogeneity
- Measurement errors or protocol deviations
- Sociodemographic confounders (education, comorbidities)

Prospective studies with standardized assessments would clarify these contributions.

### D. Clinical Implications

**1) Patient Stratification**: Clinical trials could use our pipeline to:
- Exclude atypical patients (reduce outcome variability)
- Enrich for rapid decliners (increase effect size)
- Stratify randomization by trajectory type (balance treatment groups)

**2) Personalized Medicine**: Identifying patients with unusual progression enables tailored interventions:
- Rapidly declining patients → aggressive treatment
- Stable patients → watchful waiting, lifestyle interventions
- Fluctuating patients → investigate reversible causes (depression, medications)

**3) Prognostic Counseling**: Families of patients with atypical trajectories can receive more accurate prognostic information, improving care planning and quality of life decisions.

**4) Biomarker Discovery**: Studying the 60 anomalous patients in-depth (e.g., genomic sequencing, advanced neuroimaging) may reveal novel disease mechanisms and therapeutic targets.

### E. Future Directions

**1) Multimodal Data Integration**: Incorporate neuroimaging (MRI volumes, amyloid PET), CSF biomarkers (Aβ42, tau), and genetics (APOE, polygenic risk scores) to improve anomaly detection and biological interpretation.

**2) Deep Learning Trajectory Models**: Explore recurrent neural networks (RNNs, LSTMs) or transformers to model complex nonlinear trajectories, comparing performance to our feature engineering approach.

**3) Survival Analysis**: Extend to time-to-event outcomes (e.g., progression to AD, institutionalization, mortality) using Cox models or random survival forests.

**4) Real-Time Clinical Decision Support**: Deploy pipeline as a web application or EHR-integrated tool, enabling clinicians to flag atypical patients during routine care.

**5) External Validation**: Validate on independent cohorts (NACC, AIBL, European ADNI) to assess generalizability across populations and assessment protocols.

**6) Subgroup Discovery**: Apply clustering within anomalous patients to identify distinct atypical subtypes (e.g., "rapid decliners," "fluctuators," "non-decliners").

## VI. CONCLUSION

This work presents a comprehensive unsupervised machine learning pipeline for detecting atypical cognitive trajectories in Alzheimer's disease. Analyzing 1,943 patients from the ADNI dataset with 11,017 longitudinal visits, we demonstrate that combining trajectory-based feature engineering with Isolation Forest and DBSCAN anomaly detection identifies 60 high-confidence atypical patients (8.1% of cohort) with 59.8% inter-method agreement.

Key contributions include:
1. **Robust Methodology**: Dual anomaly detection with temporal cross-validation (0.900 correlation) ensures reliable early detection
2. **Clinical Validity**: Detected anomalies exhibit biologically plausible patterns (rapid decline, fluctuating cognition, diagnostic discordance)
3. **Interpretability**: SHAP analysis reveals early rapid decline and high variability as primary drivers of anomaly status
4. **Practical Impact**: Pipeline enables patient stratification for clinical trials, personalized treatment, and prognostic counseling

Our findings advance precision medicine for Alzheimer's disease by providing a data-driven, scalable approach to identifying patients requiring specialized attention. Future work integrating multimodal biomarkers and deep learning models will further refine atypical trajectory detection, ultimately improving outcomes for this heterogeneous patient population.

The open-source implementation (https://github.com/sagarM1729/Anomaly-Detection-in-Cognitive-Trajectories) enables reproducibility and extension to other neurodegenerative diseases, fostering collaborative progress in computational neurology.
